# DerivativeCalculator

This is a symbolic differentiator in C#. 
I created it for fun for one of my courses in university, but since, I realized that this could actually be of some use to some, so currently I am working on making it ever more readable, accessible and easy to use.

Currently it can be used as a console-app, but I am planning on putting it into a .aspx website to be used from the browser.
